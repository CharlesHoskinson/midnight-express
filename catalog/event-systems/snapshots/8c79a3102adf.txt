/**
 * `saveAndAdvance` — the co-transactional composition primitive for the durable-composition
 * capability (`openspec/changes/v1.0.0-durable-checkpoint-cursor`, requirement "saveAndAdvance
 * co-commits a checkpoint and its sync cursor atomically", `design.md` §1.3).
 *
 * `CheckpointStore` has no knowledge of `Watermarks`, so this combinator lives outside
 * `PgCheckpointStore`: it takes the checkpoint store, the watermarks store, and the transaction
 * layer, opens ONE transaction, calls `checkpoints.save(..., { tx })` and then
 * `watermarks.set(..., { tx })` on the same handle, and commits both together. A crash before that
 * single COMMIT leaves neither the checkpoint nor the cursor durable — so the cursor can never be
 * made durable while the checkpoint data it describes is not (never "ahead of its data").
 *
 * Composes only in-repo primitives and imports nothing from any consumer/indexer application,
 * honouring the indexer-agnostic boundary (guideline §0.3; acceptance A8).
 *
 * NOTE: as of the api-surface change (G1), this primitive IS part of the frozen 1.0.0 public
 * surface -- `src/index.ts` re-exports `saveAndAdvance` (and its `SaveAndAdvanceDeps`/
 * `SaveAndAdvanceCursor` types) as the co-transactional composition primitive a consumer uses
 * to co-commit a checkpoint and its sync cursor. Its signature below is therefore frozen: no
 * breaking change in a 1.x minor/patch.
